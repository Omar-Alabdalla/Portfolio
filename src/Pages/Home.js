    <p1>
      My name is <f>Omar Alabdalla</f>, I am a Junior Developer hoping to pursue
      a career in <f>Computer Science</f>.
      <br /> Coding languages I currently work with include{" "}
      <f>JavaScript, React, Java, C++, and Python</f>. Areas of experience
      <br /> include <f>HTML</f> and <f>Web Development</f>, <f>RESTful</f>{" "}
      coding through Scratch and <f>REST API </f>
      development, application development, and
      <br /> <f>CyberSecurity</f>. I currently am going to college part time to
      get a degree in computer science.
      <br /> I first began learning about coding in middle school with block
      coding through <f>Scratch</f>
      <br /> Although I enjoyed it I still believed that there had to be more to
      coding than block coding.
      <br /> I decided to learn a bit of <f>batch</f> development but this still
      didnt satisy me so I withheld my learning until High School.
      <br /> In High school I decided to take every programming class I could,
      and was able to learn the basics of <f>Web Development</f>.
      <br /> I also was able to learn the advanced aspects of <f>Java</f> which
      I applied to create a game.
      <br /> Although I had learned a lot up to senior year I still wasnt
      satisfied with my progress so I decided to create my first project.
      <br /> When I was trying to think of what I might be able to make that I
      would continue development on I came to only one conclusion.
      <br />
      <f> A Discord Bot.</f> I began with no prior knowledge of coding outside
      of basic html programming and Java development.
      <br /> However this was the part that excited me the most since it was a
      whole new type of programming.
      <br /> I didn't have any specific due date nor any features I had to add
      all I had to do was make the bot.
      <br /> After asking a few friends what I should add to the bot I decided
      to add a feature to search weather in any zipcode.
      <br /> At first I thought this would be a simple mater but instead it
      ended up required a lot of high level knowledge.
      <br /> This led me to learn <f>RESTful</f> programming which I also
      learned how to use in relation to <f>Python</f>.
      <br /> From here I decided to take the Blue Valley Caps program which
      forced me to take on three major projects.
      <br /> The intention wasn't to finish all three but rather to get each one
      presentable with a finished product in mind.
      <br /> At the end of the semester you were then forced to present in front
      of the parents of all the students.
      <br /> This program taught me more than just programming however it also
      taught me professionalism in a workplace.
      <br /> After the program ended I was able to interview with{" "}
      <f>Mazuma Credit Union</f> to get an internship as a{" "}
      <f>Software Developer</f>.
      <br /> This internship was able to round out my skills really well to
      teach me professionalism as well as programming in the workplace.
